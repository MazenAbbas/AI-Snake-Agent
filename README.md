AI-Snake-Agent: A Reinforcement Learning Agent with a Visual Environment.

This project demonstrates the principles of Reinforcement Learning (RL) by building an intelligent agent that learns to play the classic Snake game. A key feature of this project is the inclusion of a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Pygame, which allows for a direct, visual observation of the agent's learning process.

The agent starts with no prior knowledge and is trained to navigate the game environment, eat food, and avoid obstacles through a system of rewards and penalties. Watching the agent interact with the game in real-time provides a deep understanding of how RL algorithms work.

Key Features
Reinforcement Learning: Applies fundamental RL concepts to a simple game environment.

Visual Environment (GUI): The agent interacts with a graphical window, offering a clear and intuitive view of its actions and learning progress.

Reward System: The agent is rewarded for eating food and penalized for colliding with walls or its own body, which guides its learning process.

Sequential Decision Making: The agent learns to make a sequence of optimal decisions over time, showcasing the core of RL.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Pygame: Used to create the game's visual environment.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Linux Environment: Specifically tested and confirmed to work on a Linux operating system.

How to Run the Project
To run this project, you need a local Python environment that supports graphical user interfaces.

Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install numpy pygame
Run the Project:
Save the project code in a file (e.g., snake_rl.py) and run it from your terminal.

Bash

python snake_rl.py
The game window will appear, and you can watch the agent learn and improve over time.
